# Squarespace Utility for Alfred
> Various keyboard shortcut utilities for Squarespace users and developers.



## Overview
This utility is a workflow for the Mac Aflred app. It creates a few global hotkey commands to let you do the following tasks:

* Login to a Squarespace website
* Search Squarespace Support
* Search Squarespace Answers
* Search Squarespace Support & Answers (with one command)
* Search Squarefront


### How It Works
It's simple, simply install the workflow file above by saving this repo to your computer and double-clicking [Squarespace-Utility.alfredworkflow](Squarespace-Utility.alfredworkflow). It should automatically install to Alfred, and you're ready to go.

The hotkey is currently set to `sq`. First call Alfred using your global hotkey (Opt-Space by default). Second, start type `sq`, press the spacebar, then type your keyword.
